# NotebookBallCustomClassifier
This custom classifier in python3 uses a pre-built tensorflow to predict whether the image contains a ball or a notebook. The database I have built by myself, and it is not a prebuilt dataset. It contains 10 images in all, of which 8 is used at training images and 2 are used as testing images.
